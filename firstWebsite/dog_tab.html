            <p> Shadow People are humanoid-like, shrouded beings that often appear out of the corner of the eye. These are fast entities that dissipate from sight as soon
			as one attempts to look at them directly. These shadowed figures are not known to interact with physical matter, they simply linger and do what appears to 
			be observing us when we're not paying attention. If encountered, do not panic, as they are mostly harmless. <br><br>
			
			One may think their mind is playing tricks and they're the only ones who witnessed this phenomenom, but there are account of multiple individuals seeing the
			same shadow person at the same time. There is even a theory that suggests, that we appear as shadow people to them in their own realm.

			<h3> <span class = "logo_red" >鬼 円</span> - SPIRIT ORBS </h3>
            <p> Ghost Orbs are luminous sphere-like apparitions that float in unpredictable patterns. Sometimes slow, other times fast, these orbs tend to
				remain in one particular spot, usually a room in a house, or a small space of their choosing outdoors. They don't go through walls which
				suggests they can interact with physical matter.<br><br>
			
				These orbs indicate the possible presence of a spirit who remains lingering in our earthly realm. They are not known to cause any harm, and are
				best left alone.
